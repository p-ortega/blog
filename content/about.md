Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo, originally from Chile but now enjoying life in the beautiful country of Aus (Perth - mind the gap). I'm a computational geoscientist with a solid nine years of experience in consulting, specializing in numerical modeling. 

I'm a huge fan of simulating, predicting, and quantifying how contaminants move around in groundwater. Whether it's tracking PFAS, Cu<sup>2+</sup> or hydrocarbons, I love digging into the nitty-gritty of their fate and transport. I'm also pretty enthusiastic about modeling in-situ metal recovery, figuring out how we can dissolve and transport metals right where they are underground (decarbonisation is totally hyping this up). I'm keen to applied uncertainty analysis and optimization for reactive transport and transport-only problems.

To be honest, anything that mixes processes in the subsurface and involves some serious computing gets me pumped. But life has taken me on this journey where I've specialized in the areas I just mentioned previously. Right now, I'm rocking it as a groundwater modeler for [Intera Inc](https://www.intera.com), working on decision support models.

So yeah, that's a bit about me. Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about anything reactive transport-related or python or computing or anything else that floats your boat!
