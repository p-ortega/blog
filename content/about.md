Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo, a geoscientist with nine years of extensive experience in consulting (hydrogeology and hydrochemistry) and research, and about to complete my PhD in geochemistry and reactive transport modelling at the University of Western Australia. I have experience simulating, predicting, and quantifying the fate and transport of contaminants and metals in groundwater (e.g., PFAS and Cu$^{2+}$) and modelling the in-situ metal recovery via dissolution and transport processes. 

I'm currently working in WSP
