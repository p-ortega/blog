Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo, originally from Chile but now enjoying life in the beautiful country of Aus (Perth - mind the gap). I'm a computational geoscientist with a solid nine years of experience in consulting, specializing in hydrogeochemistry. Currently, I'm just about to wrap up my PhD in geochemistry and reactive transport modeling at the University of Western Australia in Perth.

I'm a huge fan of simulating, predicting, and quantifying how contaminants move around in groundwater. Whether it's tracking PFAS or Cu$^{2+}$, I love digging into the nitty-gritty of their fate and transport. I'm also pretty enthusiastic about modelling in-situ metal recovery, figuring out how we can dissolve and transport metals right where they are underground (decarbonisation is totally hyping this up).

To be honest, anything that mixes processes in the subsurface and involves some serious computing gets me pumped. But life has taken me on this journey where I've specialized in the areas I just mentioned previously. Right now, I'm rocking it as a groundwater modeller for a consulting company (WSP), working with their contaminated sites teams.

So yeah, that's a bit about me. Feel free to hit me up if you want to chat about anything reactive transport-related or python or computing or anything else that floats your boat!
